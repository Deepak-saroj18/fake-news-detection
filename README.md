# Fake News Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a Fake News Prediction model, leveraging machine learning techniques to classify news articles as real or fake. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

# Project Overview
Fake news is a prevalent issue in todayâ€™s digital world, affecting public opinion and potentially leading to misinformation. This project aims to develop a model that can accurately classify news articles as "Fake" or "Real" based on their content. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning models, the notebook demonstrates a systematic approach to text-based classification.
